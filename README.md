# FAQ

## I don't know what project deadline and exam date apply to me (Master & EMSE Students)

Look at your timetable (schedule) from your institution. If your exam is scheduled the 13th of December, you have to do the first part of the project. If your exam is scheduled in January, then you have to do the complete project.
